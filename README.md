### Template Match with rotation using NCC
This project is a proof of concept about how to match template in arbitrarily angle of image by using normalized cross-correlation(NCC)
1. template_match_core.py: core function of matching template
2. test_ideal.py: test matching function in ideal image to verify the accuracy of algorithm
3. test_images.py test matching function in arbitrarily image


### Requirement package
```
numpy
opencv-python
```
