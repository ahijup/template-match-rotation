### Template Match with rotation using NCC
This project is a proof of concept about how to match a template in an image containing a single target at arbitrary angles by using normalized cross-correlation (NCC) 
1. template_match_core.py: core function of matching template
2. test_ideal.py: Test the matching function on an ideal image to verify the accuracy of the algorithm
3. test_images.py Test the matching function on a template image at arbitrary angles.


### Required package
```
numpy
opencv-python
```
